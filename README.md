â€¢ Q&A Chatbot using RAG, Agents, and Ollama
A simple chatbot was built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), intelligent agents, and the LLaMA 3 model (via Ollama). The chatbot answers user questions through one of three methods:

1- Retrieving relevant information from LangChain documentation,

2- Searching the web using a SerpAPI agent, or

3- Executing Python code using a Repl agent.

A Gradio interface is provided for user interaction.
